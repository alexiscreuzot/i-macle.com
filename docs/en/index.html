On the other hand, we work with pedagogical sequences so that the student remembers in each class what the previous class saw. Each topic is related to the following: repetition is the basis for strengthening and systematizing the knowledge already acquired. <br/> <br/> In addition, students improvise dialogues about their life, have conversations and act a social role (play play) with their classmates to function in real -life situations. This is essential since the student is a member of a society and must be able to communicate, act and interact with the other members of their environment.
