  long: "<b>“El alumno debe ser capaz de realizar una acción.” </b>
        <br/><br/>
        El alumno tiene pequeñas tareas en clase, misiones y desafíos sobre situaciones de la vida diaria. Tal como sucede cuando se vive en el extranjero. De esta forma el alumno poco a poco desarrolla la capacidad para analizar, descifrar y aplicar nuevos conocimientos en su entorno social. 
        Por otro lado, trabajamos con secuencias pedagógicas para que el alumno recuerde en cada clase lo que vio la clase anterior. Cada tema se relaciona con el siguiente: la repetición es la base para reforzar y sistematizar los conocimientos ya adquiridos. <br/><br/>
        Además los alumnos improvisan diálogos sobre su vida, entablan conversaciones y actúan un papel social (rol play) con sus compañeros para desenvolverse en situaciones de la vida real. Esto es primordial ya que el alumno es miembro de una sociedad y debe poder comunicarse, actuar e interactuar con los demás miembros de su entorno.
        Nuestro propósito es que aprendas a hablar, escribir, escuchar y leer en el idioma que elijas para trabajar, viajar, vivir en el extranjero y/o por placer. <br/><br/>
        Habla una lengua extranjera para descubrir el mundo y entenderlo. Conoce nuevas personas viajando o en tu país. Trabaja con empresas internacionales y forma parte de nuevas comunidades reales o virtuales."
